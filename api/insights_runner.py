"""Post-sync LLM insight generation runner.

Called after a sync finishes. Runs three insight generators (daily_brief,
training_review, race_forecast), each gated by:

- A *content-addressable* dataset hash: skip if the inputs that drive the
  insight haven't materially changed since the last generation.
- A *per-user daily cap*: skip remaining types if the cap is exhausted.

When the LLM is unavailable (Azure endpoint unset, SDK missing) the
generators return ``None`` and the rule-based prose elsewhere in the app
serves as the fallback. Sync never fails because of this hook — call sites
always wrap it in try/except.

Transaction ownership: the runner opens its own ``SessionLocal`` so its
commits / rollbacks are fully isolated from the caller's sync session.
The caller's ``db`` parameter is unused for writes — it's accepted so the
two call sites (sync route, scheduler) stay symmetric and so a future
refactor can plumb caller state without changing the signature again.
Tests inject ``_session=...`` to substitute an in-memory session.

    Args:

        db: Caller's session — used only as a "DB is ready" hint. The runner
            opens its own session for its work so its commits don't entangle
            with the sync transaction.
        counts: Per-platform row-count dict from the sync writer
            (e.g. ``{"activities": 5, "splits": 23}``). When all values
            are zero we know the sync was a no-op and skip generation.

            runner uses it directly instead of opening ``SessionLocal``.
