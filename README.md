# Praxys

Sports science that meets you where you are. Praxys syncs data from Garmin, Stryd, and Oura Ring, computes training metrics (fitness/fatigue/form, zone analysis, CP trend, race predictions), and serves a modern web dashboard with AI-powered coaching skills — for elite athletes, serious amateurs, and curious beginners alike.

> **Note:** Praxys is the new name for the project formerly known as Trainsight. The on-disk database file (`trainsight.db`) and legacy `TRAINSIGHT_*` environment variables continue to work during the deprecation window — see `docs/brand/index.html` for the brand guideline.

## Usage Modes

**Cloud app (recommended):** Deployed on Azure at [praxys.run](https://praxys.run). Register, connect your platforms, sync data, and view the dashboard from anywhere. AI features available via the CLI plugin in remote mode.

**Local development:** Same codebase runs locally. Start the backend and frontend dev servers, register as the first user (becomes admin), and you are up and running.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
# Add the generated key as PRAXYS_LOCAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY in .env

# 3. Start the API server
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# 4. Start the frontend dev server (separate terminal)
cd web && npm install && npm run dev

# 5. Open http://localhost:5173 and register as the first user (becomes admin)
```

For sample data without API credentials: `python scripts/seed_sample_data.py`
