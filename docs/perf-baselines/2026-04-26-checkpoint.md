# Perf checkpoint — 2026-04-26

A snapshot of where Praxys' user-perceived performance stands after the recent four-fix arc (Phase-1 #1 self-host fonts, PWA precache, PR-139 backend pragmas + DEK cache, F4 frontend co-location). This is the **"before" reference** for the next round of work — the L1/L2/L3 backend-call optimizations targeted at Today / Training cold load.

Numerical sources for every claim below are the committed baselines in `docs/perf-baselines/`. This file consolidates every metric across every probe, including the ones that didn't move or that regressed — full picture, not just the wins.

## What's been fixed so far

| Phase | What | Anchor showing the gain |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 #1 | Self-hosted fonts (eliminated Google Fonts blocking on raw CN ISP) | `2026-04-25-667dcc2/` — S4 cn-pc-2 desktop FCP **22476 ms → 2892 ms** (−87 %) |
| Phase 2 #4 (F2) | Folded `/api/plan/stryd-status` into `/api/plan` (one fewer round-trip on Training cold load) | `2026-04-25-d37484b/` set the S1/S2/S3 anchor right before this |
| PR-139 | SQLite WAL pragmas + 20 MB page cache + per-DEK unwrap LRU | `2026-04-25-c73e4a1-backend-perf/` — synthetic-load script measured `/api/today` p50 **5194 ms → 1839 ms** (−65 %) |
| PR-141/142 (F4) | Frontend off SWA-Amsterdam onto App Service East Asia (`praxys-frontend`); apex `praxys.run` lives | `2026-04-26-1358017/` — see comprehensive tables below |

## Data sources for this checkpoint

| Scenario | Pre-arc anchor | "Now" anchor |
|---|---|---|
| S1/S2/S3 (login-gated) | `2026-04-25-d37484b/` (cn-pc-2 only) | `2026-04-26-1358017/` (cn-pc + cn-pc-2) |
| S4 (anonymous landing) | `2026-04-24-468ce25/` (raw, cn-pc + cn-pc-2) | `2026-04-26-1358017/` (cn-pc + cn-pc-2) |

The S4 pre-arc starts from `468ce25` (raw, before any Phase-1 work) so the delta captures the full fix arc including self-host fonts. The S1/S2/S3 pre-arc starts from `d37484b` because that's our oldest login-scripted baseline; cn-pc S1/S2/S3 has no committed pre-arc data, so those rows show only "now".

Cloud-region probes (`eastasia` / `westus` / `northeurope`) — pending; needs PR-145 (workflow rewrite) to land + a first sweep against the new origin. Will be appended to this file once we have the data.

### cn-pc-2 (passwall2 OFF — real mainland-CN ISP, what your friends without VPN see)

| Metric | Desktop pre | Desktop now | Δ | Mobile pre | Mobile now | Δ |

| API p95 (ms) | 4112 | 3839 | −273 (−7 %) | 3759 | **2520** | **−1239 (−33 %)** |

### cn-pc (passwall2 ON — overseas tunnel "control"; no pre-arc S1 baseline)

| Metric | Desktop now | Mobile now | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| FCP (ms) | 1684 | 1736 | comparable to cn-pc-2 now — passwall no longer "wins" |
| LCP (ms) | 1684 | 1736 | |
| TTI (ms) | 538 | 519 | |
| HTML TTFB (ms) | 515 | 510 | |
| Static KB | 1361.0 | 2399.6 | |
| # reqs | 81 | 108 | |
| API p50 (ms) | 201 | 169 | |
| API p95 (ms) | 1136 | 4280 | desktop fast / mobile slow — single-iteration tail |

### Observations

- **The wins are all in render path.** FCP/LCP/TTI/TTFB drop 29-52 % because F4 eliminated the Amsterdam round-trip on every blocking asset.
- **Mobile API p50 went UP +22 %** — odd against the rest of the picture. Sample is 3 iterations × 48 calls; p50 of small samples is noisy. Mobile p95 dropped 33 % so the headline-tail story holds; treat the p50 +22 % as noise unless it persists across follow-up runs.
- **Static-KB drop on mobile is bigger than desktop** (−47 % vs −13 %). Probably a viewport-aware bundle-split kicking in correctly post-F4 — Vite emits different chunks per breakpoint and mobile got a slimmer initial bundle.

| API p95 (ms) | 4102 | 4001 | −101 (−2 %) | 4814 | 4196 | **−618 (−13 %)** |

⚠ **S2 desktop LCP 1100 ms in the pre-arc was an explicit outlier** — the d37484b README flagged it: "Mobile LCP 5336 ms vs Desktop 1100 ms is a 5× gap not network-explained… probably one bad iteration." Post-arc desktop and mobile both land around 5 s, consistent with the "chart-needs-API-to-paint" pattern observed everywhere else. The "regression" is the outlier reverting to the mean, not a real slowdown.

### cn-pc (passwall2 ON; no pre-arc S2 baseline)

| Metric | Desktop now | Mobile now |
|---|---|---|
| FCP (ms) | 1156 | 692 |
| LCP (ms) | 12668 | 1220 |
| TTI (ms) | 21 | 24 |
| HTML TTFB (ms) | 5 | 7 |
| API p50 (ms) | 159 | 145 |
| API p95 (ms) | 5295 | 4706 |

### Observations

- **Mobile S2 LCP −5 %, p95 −13 %.** Real wins, modest, expected — Training page is mostly chart-blocked-on-API.
- **Static KB +158 % desktop, −46 % mobile.** Bundle-split mismatch between viewports — probably worth investigating but small absolute size impact.
- **cn-pc desktop LCP 12668 ms** — wildly worse than cn-pc-2 desktop 4920 ms. The architectural-inversion fingerprint: passwall ON sends API calls through overseas tunnel before reaching East Asia origin, adding latency the chart paints late.

### cn-pc (passwall2 ON; no pre-arc S3 baseline)

| Metric | Desktop now | Mobile now |
|---|---|---|

| API p50 (ms) | 147 | 171 |
| API p95 (ms) | 4235 | 4685 |

### Observations

- **Mobile LCP −44 %** — biggest single move on the board. Pre-arc 9732 ms was waiting on `/api/today` (then ~4.4 s) plus chart paint; post-arc both halves of that chain are faster.
- **Desktop LCP +21 %** — mild regression, σ-bounded at 3 iterations. Worth a follow-up if it reproduces; for now treated as noise.
- **Mobile Static KB −100 %** (902 → 1.1 KB) — PWA precache fully active on warm visits. Pre-arc PWA wasn't yet in S3 path (PR-122 landed during the arc); now mobile reads the entire shell from disk.

⚠ **cn-pc desktop FCP +26 %** is the architectural-inversion fingerprint. Pre-arc, passwall2 ON routed CN traffic through an overseas tunnel which BYPASSED the GFW-throttled CN→AMS path that SWA-Amsterdam was forcing. Post-arc with the origin in East Asia (HK), passwall2 ON now routes CN-ISP→overseas→HK — adding hops that direct CN-ISP→HK doesn't pay. This is the right outcome: friends without VPN now have the optimal path; friends with VPN pay a small tunnel cost to get an architecture that benefits the audience overall.

### Observations

- **The headline win for the audience-without-VPN: 22.5 s → 1.5 s FCP cold landing on raw CN ISP.** That's a 21-second cut per cold visit.
- **Static KB up across all rows.** Self-hosted fonts (PR-G era) and the larger-but-PWA-friendly bundle are the cause. Bigger absolute payload, but it actually arrives now (pre-arc the WOFF2 fetches were timing out at TLS, never reaching the browser).
- **Request count up.** Same reason — fonts, vendor chunks, brand assets that previously timed out now successfully fetch.

## Cross-endpoint API median (App Insights — server-side, real production traffic)

### Pre-PR-139 (1 week of organic traffic before PR-139 landed)

| Endpoint | Calls | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/today` | 21 | 5194 | 11887 |
| `GET /api/training` | 3 | 4127 | 15938 |
| `GET /api/science` | 11 | 4404 | 15549 |
| `GET /api/health` | 764 | 8 | 47 |
| `GET /api/settings` | 8 | 218 | 1098 |

### Post-PR-139 (synthetic-load script, n=30 burst)

| Endpoint | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p50 Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/today` | **1839** | 3998 | −3355 (−65 %) |
| `GET /api/training` | **1954** | 4391 | −2173 (−53 %) |
| `GET /api/science` | **2067** | 6566 | −2337 (−53 %) |

The clustering of three endpoints around the same 1.8-2.1 s p50 is the data-side fingerprint of the kitchen-sink anti-pattern in `get_dashboard_data()` — they're all doing the same work. L1 (#146) targets exactly this.

---

## Architectural inversion confirmed

Pre-F4: `cn-pc` (passwall2 ON) was always faster than `cn-pc-2` because passwall2 bypassed the GFW-throttled CN→AMS path that SWA-Amsterdam forced on us.

Post-F4: `cn-pc` is *consistently slower* on Praxys traffic — direct CN-ISP→HK is a shorter route than CN-ISP→overseas-tunnel→HK now that the origin lives in East Asia. Most visible cells:

| Cell | cn-pc (passwall ON) | cn-pc-2 (passwall OFF) |
|---|---|---|
| S4 desktop FCP | 3788 ms | 1636 ms |
| S2 desktop LCP | 12668 ms | 4920 ms |
| S2 desktop API p95 | 5295 ms | 4001 ms |
| S1 mobile API p95 | 4280 ms | 2520 ms |

**Friends in mainland CN without VPN now get the best Praxys experience.** That's the right outcome for the audience.

## What's still slow (and where we go next)

The user's current subjective feel:

- Landing (`praxys.run` / `www.praxys.run`): fast cold + warm. Done.
- **Today + Training: slow on cold load — data and charts take many seconds; nav bar is quick.**
- Settings, Science: feel fast.
- Warm Today/Training: better, still not snappy.

Code-read found the smoking gun without instrumentation: **five endpoints (`/api/today`, `/api/training`, `/api/goal`, `/api/history`, `/api/science`) all call the same kitchen-sink `get_dashboard_data()` function**, which runs ~22 distinct top-level computations on every request, then each endpoint returns 15-40 % of the result. The other 60-85 % of work is wasted. The four production endpoints clustering near the same 1.8-2 s p50 (post-PR-139) is the data-side fingerprint.

This is what the next three optimization layers target:

| Layer | Issue | Mechanism | Expected `/api/today` p50 after |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | [#146](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/issues/146) | Refactor `get_dashboard_data` into per-endpoint slim functions | ~400 ms (4-5× drop) |
| **L2** | [#147](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/issues/147) | ETag/304 keyed on `(user, latest_sync_timestamp)` — saves bandwidth on warm visits | minimal compute change; cuts the JSON-body re-send cost |
| **L3** | [#148](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/issues/148) | Materialize per-section caches at sync_writer commit; reads become SELECTs | ~50 ms (≈ instant) |

**L1 is required before L2 and L3 make sense** — without splitting the kitchen-sink, neither caching strategy has a sane invalidation surface. Once L1 lands, L2 is additive and L3 stays in the toolbox until the warm-visit speed of L1 stops feeling adequate.

## Tooling state

- **Local sitespeed runner** (`scripts/sitespeed_runner.sh`) — works against any URL, supports S1/S2/S3/S4 × desktop/mobile. The cn-pc / cn-pc-2 anchor numbers above all came from this. Gold standard for "what does the operator (and CN audience) actually feel."
- **Cloud sitespeed runner** (`.github/workflows/perf-baseline.yml`) — being rewritten in PR-145: matrix-driven (`scenario × probe × device` = up to 24 cells per dispatch), polling-bug fixed (was hanging cross-region runs by relying on an unreliable state field). Once PR-145 lands, we have reliable Azure-internal probes for eastasia/westus/northeurope to triangulate audience experience without needing the operator's PC. **Cloud-region rows above are still TBD.**
- **Synthetic-load validator** (`scripts/perf_synthetic_load_check.py`) — drives 30-call bursts against a deployed environment, queries App Insights for server-side p50/p95 vs a baseline window. This is what produced the PR-139 −65 % p50 measurement that synthetic browser baselines couldn't capture cleanly because of small-sample p95 noise. Reusable for every backend perf change.
- **Azure Monitor alert** — `praxys-today-latency-regression` fires when `/api/today` mean exceeds 3000 ms over a 24-h window. Catches future regressions on real traffic without us having to remember to look.

## How this checkpoint will be used

The next set of PRs (L1, L2, L3 in order) will each be measured against the cn-pc-2 column above. The acceptance gate for each layer is "Today / Training p50 reduces by at least the expected amount, no S4 / Settings / Science regression, security headers still present, suite still green." If a layer doesn't move the number, that's a signal to stop and re-diagnose rather than ship.

Anchors-of-anchors:
- Source-of-truth pre-arc: `2026-04-24-468ce25/`
- Last anchor before this checkpoint: `2026-04-26-1358017/`
- Everything below this checkpoint should compare to `1358017`'s cn-pc-2 row.
