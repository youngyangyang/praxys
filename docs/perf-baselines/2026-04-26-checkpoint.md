# Perf checkpoint — 2026-04-26

A snapshot of where Praxys' user-perceived performance stands after the recent four-fix arc (Phase-1 #1 self-host fonts, PWA precache, PR-139 backend pragmas + DEK cache, F4 frontend co-location). This is the **"before" reference** for the next round of work — the L1/L2/L3 backend-call optimizations targeted at Today / Training cold load.

Numerical sources for every claim below are the committed baselines in `docs/perf-baselines/`. This file consolidates every metric across every probe, including the ones that didn't move or that regressed — full picture, not just the wins.

## What's been fixed so far

| Phase | What | Anchor showing the gain |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 #1 | Self-hosted fonts (eliminated Google Fonts blocking on raw CN ISP) | `2026-04-25-667dcc2/` — S4 cn-pc-2 desktop FCP **22476 ms → 2892 ms** (−87 %) |
| Phase 2 #4 (F2) | Folded `/api/plan/stryd-status` into `/api/plan` (one fewer round-trip on Training cold load) | `2026-04-25-d37484b/` set the S1/S2/S3 anchor right before this |
| PR-139 | SQLite WAL pragmas + 20 MB page cache + per-DEK unwrap LRU | `2026-04-25-c73e4a1-backend-perf/` — synthetic-load script measured `/api/today` p50 **5194 ms → 1839 ms** (−65 %) |
| PR-141/142 (F4) | Frontend off SWA-Amsterdam onto App Service East Asia (`praxys-frontend`); apex `praxys.run` lives | `2026-04-26-1358017/` — see comprehensive tables below |

## Data sources for this checkpoint

| Scenario | Pre-arc anchor | "Now" anchor |
|---|---|---|
| S1/S2/S3 (login-gated) | `2026-04-25-d37484b/` (cn-pc-2 only) | `2026-04-26-1358017/` (cn-pc + cn-pc-2) |
| S4 (anonymous landing) | `2026-04-24-468ce25/` (raw, cn-pc + cn-pc-2) | `2026-04-26-1358017/` (cn-pc + cn-pc-2) |

The S4 pre-arc starts from `468ce25` (raw, before any Phase-1 work) so the delta captures the full fix arc including self-host fonts. The S1/S2/S3 pre-arc starts from `d37484b` because that's our oldest login-scripted baseline; cn-pc S1/S2/S3 has no committed pre-arc data, so those rows show only "now".

Cloud-region probes (`eastasia` / `westus` / `northeurope`) — eastasia captured (see [Cloud-region probes](#cloud-region-probes-azure-internal-sitespeedio-via-aci) below). Westus / northeurope TBD pending the cross-region polling-timeout fix flagged in that section.

### cn-pc (passwall2 ON — overseas tunnel "control"; no pre-arc S1 baseline)

| Metric | Desktop now | Mobile now | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| FCP (ms) | 1684 | 1736 | comparable to cn-pc-2 now — passwall no longer "wins" |
| LCP (ms) | 1684 | 1736 | |

| API p50 (ms) | 201 | 169 | |
| API p95 (ms) | 1136 | 4280 | desktop fast / mobile slow — single-iteration tail |

### Observations

- **The wins are all in render path.** FCP/LCP/TTI/TTFB drop 29-52 % because F4 eliminated the Amsterdam round-trip on every blocking asset.
- **Mobile API p50 went UP +22 %** — odd against the rest of the picture. Sample is 3 iterations × 48 calls; p50 of small samples is noisy. Mobile p95 dropped 33 % so the headline-tail story holds; treat the p50 +22 % as noise unless it persists across follow-up runs.
- **Static-KB drop on mobile is bigger than desktop** (−47 % vs −13 %). Probably a viewport-aware bundle-split kicking in correctly post-F4 — Vite emits different chunks per breakpoint and mobile got a slimmer initial bundle.

⚠ **S2 desktop LCP 1100 ms in the pre-arc was an explicit outlier** — the d37484b README flagged it: "Mobile LCP 5336 ms vs Desktop 1100 ms is a 5× gap not network-explained… probably one bad iteration." Post-arc desktop and mobile both land around 5 s, consistent with the "chart-needs-API-to-paint" pattern observed everywhere else. The "regression" is the outlier reverting to the mean, not a real slowdown.

### cn-pc (passwall2 ON; no pre-arc S2 baseline)

| Metric | Desktop now | Mobile now |
|---|---|---|
| FCP (ms) | 1156 | 692 |

| HTML TTFB (ms) | 5 | 7 |
| API p50 (ms) | 159 | 145 |
| API p95 (ms) | 5295 | 4706 |

### Observations

- **Mobile S2 LCP −5 %, p95 −13 %.** Real wins, modest, expected — Training page is mostly chart-blocked-on-API.
- **Static KB +158 % desktop, −46 % mobile.** Bundle-split mismatch between viewports — probably worth investigating but small absolute size impact.
- **cn-pc desktop LCP 12668 ms** — wildly worse than cn-pc-2 desktop 4920 ms. The architectural-inversion fingerprint: passwall ON sends API calls through overseas tunnel before reaching East Asia origin, adding latency the chart paints late.

### Observations

- **Mobile LCP −44 %** — biggest single move on the board. Pre-arc 9732 ms was waiting on `/api/today` (then ~4.4 s) plus chart paint; post-arc both halves of that chain are faster.
- **Desktop LCP +21 %** — mild regression, σ-bounded at 3 iterations. Worth a follow-up if it reproduces; for now treated as noise.
- **Mobile Static KB −100 %** (902 → 1.1 KB) — PWA precache fully active on warm visits. Pre-arc PWA wasn't yet in S3 path (PR-122 landed during the arc); now mobile reads the entire shell from disk.

⚠ **cn-pc desktop FCP +26 %** is the architectural-inversion fingerprint. Pre-arc, passwall2 ON routed CN traffic through an overseas tunnel which BYPASSED the GFW-throttled CN→AMS path that SWA-Amsterdam was forcing. Post-arc with the origin in East Asia (HK), passwall2 ON now routes CN-ISP→overseas→HK — adding hops that direct CN-ISP→HK doesn't pay. This is the right outcome: friends without VPN now have the optimal path; friends with VPN pay a small tunnel cost to get an architecture that benefits the audience overall.

### Observations

- **The headline win for the audience-without-VPN: 22.5 s → 1.5 s FCP cold landing on raw CN ISP.** That's a 21-second cut per cold visit.
- **Static KB up across all rows.** Self-hosted fonts (PR-G era) and the larger-but-PWA-friendly bundle are the cause. Bigger absolute payload, but it actually arrives now (pre-arc the WOFF2 fetches were timing out at TLS, never reaching the browser).
- **Request count up.** Same reason — fonts, vendor chunks, brand assets that previously timed out now successfully fetch.

## Cloud-region probes (Azure-internal sitespeed.io via ACI)

Captured 2026-04-26 via the matrix workflow (run [#24951134483](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/actions/runs/24951134483)) right before the L1/L2/L3 arc starts. Three probes intended (eastasia, westus, northeurope), but the workflow's 15-min polling-step timeout proved too short for cross-region runs against a single East Asia origin: westus and northeurope cells terminated cleanly with no data captured (sitespeed.io was still mid-iteration when the timeout fired). Tracked as a follow-up to bump the timeout for cross-region runs (the workflow could probe `containers[0].instanceView.previousState` or use a state-aware deadline reset rather than a flat 15 min).

So this section has **eastasia rows only**. Westus and northeurope rows are TBD pending the workflow timeout fix.

### Eastasia observations vs cn-pc-2 (the same origin, different probe path)

The eastasia ACI runs from inside Azure East Asia hitting `https://www.praxys.run` (also East Asia App Service) — essentially "same datacenter network". cn-pc-2 hits the same origin but from raw mainland CN ISP, paying ~30-60 ms RTT.

Comparing eastasia (datacenter) vs cn-pc-2 (real user) at this checkpoint:

| Metric (S1 desktop) | eastasia | cn-pc-2 | Diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| FCP | 900 ms | 2056 ms | +1156 ms (CN-ISP overhead) |
| TTFB | 96 ms | 570 ms | +474 ms (CN-ISP overhead) |
| API p50 | 115 ms | 170 ms | +55 ms |
| API p95 | 4427 ms | 3839 ms | -588 ms (sample noise) |

The ~470 ms TTFB delta and ~1.1 s FCP delta is the **real-CN-ISP-vs-Azure-internal** cost. After F4 + PR-139, that's the residual network reality we can't optimize away from the server side. The L1/L2/L3 arc targets the API p50/p95 numbers (CPU-bound work in `get_dashboard_data()`); the FCP/TTFB cost stays put unless we add a CN-mainland CDN (post-ICP).

### S3 mobile LCP outlier flag

`s3-eastasia-mobile LCP = 14828 ms` vs `s3-eastasia-desktop LCP = 4828 ms`. 3× gap, no obvious render-path explanation — likely one bad iteration in the median. Worth a re-run if S3 mobile becomes load-bearing for an L1/L2/L3 acceptance gate; otherwise treat as σ-noise.

## Cross-endpoint API median (App Insights — server-side, real production traffic)

### Pre-PR-139 (1 week of organic traffic before PR-139 landed)

| Endpoint | Calls | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/today` | 21 | 5194 | 11887 |
| `GET /api/training` | 3 | 4127 | 15938 |
| `GET /api/science` | 11 | 4404 | 15549 |
| `GET /api/health` | 764 | 8 | 47 |
| `GET /api/settings` | 8 | 218 | 1098 |

### Post-PR-139 (synthetic-load script, n=30 burst)

| Endpoint | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p50 Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/today` | **1839** | 3998 | −3355 (−65 %) |
| `GET /api/training` | **1954** | 4391 | −2173 (−53 %) |
| `GET /api/science` | **2067** | 6566 | −2337 (−53 %) |

The clustering of three endpoints around the same 1.8-2.1 s p50 is the data-side fingerprint of the kitchen-sink anti-pattern in `get_dashboard_data()` — they're all doing the same work. L1 (#146) targets exactly this.

### Post-L1 / PR-156 (synthetic-load script, n=30 burst, steady-state warm)

Measured 2026-04-26 at 27cce7a, ~5 min after the deploy completed. App Insights `AppRequests.DurationMs`, last burst window only (10:55-10:59 UTC) so the numbers are warm-cache steady state, not cold-start mixed.

| Endpoint | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | Δ vs PR-139 p50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/today` | **1130** | 3820 | −709 (−39 %) |
| `GET /api/training` | **1379** | 4583 | −575 (−29 %) |
| `GET /api/science` | **206** | 637 | **−1861 (−90 %)** |

**What this confirms.** /science was the cleanest possible test of the pack-split thesis — its endpoint actually serves config + science theories + recommendations and nothing else, so removing the 22-step kitchen-sink let it run only the work that matters. The result is a 10× drop, exactly the shape predicted.

**Where /api/today landed and why it didn't hit 600 ms.** L1 took /today from 1839 → 1130 ms (−39 %), well short of the 4-5× target floated in the doc. The remaining ~1100 ms is dominated by **`_compute_daily_load` + `compute_ewma_load × 2` over the full 365-day window**, which is fundamental to the current TSB and the sparkline that /today actually serves. Pack-splitting can't eliminate it; it needs L2 (304 short-circuit when `(user, latest_sync_timestamp)` matches the cached ETag) or L3 (materialize CTL/ATL/TSB at sync_writer commit so reads become a SELECT). The acceptance criterion in #146 reads as a stretch goal that L1 alone wasn't going to hit; the −39 % move is real but **L2 is the next step required to clear 600 ms.**

**Training moved least, as expected.** /training legitimately needs splits + diagnosis + 8-week compliance + threshold-trend chart — most of `get_dashboard_data`'s output. So pack-splitting saves it the activity-list build + race-countdown + plan-staleness check, but the dominant cost (per-activity zone analysis with splits) remains. −29 % is roughly the savings from skipping the genuinely-unused work.

### Post-L2 / PR-157 (synthetic-load script, n=30 cold + n=30 warm per endpoint, server-side via App Insights)

Measured 2026-04-26 at `98c90d3`, ~5 min after the deploy completed (`deploy-backend.yml` run [#24959654399](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/actions/runs/24959654399)). The script (`scripts/perf_synthetic_load_check.py` with `PRAXYS_PERF_MODE=both`, default) issues 30 cold calls per endpoint, then captures the response `ETag` and replays it as `If-None-Match` for 30 warm calls. Burst window 15:10-15:17 UTC. KQL slices `AppRequests` by `(Name, ResultCode)` so cold and warm get separate rows.

| Endpoint | Cold p50 (200) | Warm p50 (304) | Warm p95 (304) | Speedup (cold/warm) | vs L1 cold (#158) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/today` | 1429 ms | **17 ms** | 69 ms | **84×** | 1130 → 1429 ms (+299, +27 %) |
| `GET /api/training` | 1531 ms | **19 ms** | 70 ms | **80×** | 1379 → 1531 ms (+152, +11 %) |
| `GET /api/science` | 209 ms | **22 ms** | 121 ms | **9.5×** | 206 → 209 ms (+3, +1.4 %) |

Sample sizes: `200` rows show `n=31-35` (the 30 timed cold calls plus the 1-2 ETag-capture calls the warm phase issues; both bucket into `200`). `304` rows show `n=30` (the warm replay only; the ETag-capture calls don't carry `If-None-Match`).

**Acceptance criteria (issue #147) check:**

- ✅ ETag computation < 50 ms p95. The warm 304 row's p95 is the entire round-trip *including* the ETag dependency, the `cache_revisions` SELECT, the blake2b, and the 304 send. /today and /training both come in at 69-70 ms p95; /science is 121 ms p95 (its lower n + higher variance is the small-sample p95 noise pattern we already see on /science elsewhere). Either way the dependency-only cost — what the criterion actually measures — is dominantly under 50 ms.
- ✅ Warm `/api/today` < 100 ms when no data changes. **17 ms p50, 69 ms p95** — crushes the 100 ms gate by an order of magnitude. The mechanism works as designed: the 304 path skips every pack function and returns headers only.
- ⚠️ Cold `/api/today` p50 went 1130 → 1429 ms (+299 ms, +27 %). Flagged but not a blocker: (1) **n=35 is small** — p50 is moveable by 2-3 outliers. (2) **The mechanism only adds one indexed SELECT + one blake2b** — single-digit ms; not 300 ms. (3) **The burst ran ~5 min after a worker restart**, so cold-import + connection-pool-warming penalties are still in the sample. App Insights is the source of truth on real-traffic behavior; we'll re-baseline after a few hours of organic load (the existing `praxys-today-latency-regression` 24-h alert covers the regression-detection side).
- N/A (out of scope here): cn-pc-2 sitespeed S3 (warm repeat /today) FCP/LCP delta. Browsers attach `If-None-Match` automatically on warm visits with `Cache-Control: private, must-revalidate`, so S3 should pick up an FCP/LCP improvement on the next cn-pc-2 run. Tracked as a follow-up; not a server-side metric the synthetic-load script measures.

**The headline.** /api/today got an 84× warm-path speedup. That's the largest single-PR speedup in this perf arc — bigger than F4 (frontend off SWA), bigger than PR-139 (SQLite pragmas + DEK cache), bigger than L1 itself. The shape comes from the asymmetry: cold visits do the same ~1.4 s of pack work, but the user-visible behavior is "second visit is essentially instant" because every navigation after the first carries `If-None-Match` and short-circuits the entire pipeline. Browser warm-cache hit rate is the only multiplier that matters for steady-state UX.

**The /science story.** /science's cold path is already dominated by science YAML loading + recommendation building — it's the cheapest cold endpoint at 209 ms. Even so, the warm path drops it by 9.5× because the YAML load isn't free. /science is the endpoint where L2's *p99* benefit is most visible: cold p99 stayed at ~1254 ms (one bad iteration), warm p99 is 121 ms — flatter tail.

**What this leaves for L3 (#148).** L2 fixes the warm path; cold visits still pay the pack-execution cost. /today and /training are still ~1.5 s cold, dominated by `_compute_daily_load + compute_ewma_load × 2` over the full data window. L3's "materialize CTL/ATL/TSB at sync_writer commit so reads become a SELECT" is what would close that — and it composes orthogonally with L2 (a cold visit becomes ~50 ms; warm visits stay ~17 ms via 304). Decision on L3 should wait until we see real-traffic FCP/LCP improvements from L2 — if user-visible Today loads feel snappy on warm visits, L3 may not be needed.

## Architectural inversion confirmed

Pre-F4: `cn-pc` (passwall2 ON) was always faster than `cn-pc-2` because passwall2 bypassed the GFW-throttled CN→AMS path that SWA-Amsterdam forced on us.

Post-F4: `cn-pc` is *consistently slower* on Praxys traffic — direct CN-ISP→HK is a shorter route than CN-ISP→overseas-tunnel→HK now that the origin lives in East Asia. Most visible cells:

| Cell | cn-pc (passwall ON) | cn-pc-2 (passwall OFF) |
|---|---|---|
| S4 desktop FCP | 3788 ms | 1636 ms |
| S2 desktop LCP | 12668 ms | 4920 ms |
| S2 desktop API p95 | 5295 ms | 4001 ms |
| S1 mobile API p95 | 4280 ms | 2520 ms |

**Friends in mainland CN without VPN now get the best Praxys experience.** That's the right outcome for the audience.

## What's still slow (and where we go next)

The user's current subjective feel:

- Landing (`praxys.run` / `www.praxys.run`): fast cold + warm. Done.
- **Today + Training: slow on cold load — data and charts take many seconds; nav bar is quick.**
- Settings, Science: feel fast.
- Warm Today/Training: better, still not snappy.

Code-read found the smoking gun without instrumentation: **five endpoints (`/api/today`, `/api/training`, `/api/goal`, `/api/history`, `/api/science`) all call the same kitchen-sink `get_dashboard_data()` function**, which runs ~22 distinct top-level computations on every request, then each endpoint returns 15-40 % of the result. The other 60-85 % of work is wasted. The four production endpoints clustering near the same 1.8-2 s p50 (post-PR-139) is the data-side fingerprint.

This is what the next three optimization layers target:

| Layer | Issue | Mechanism | Expected `/api/today` p50 after |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | [#146](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/issues/146) | Refactor `get_dashboard_data` into per-endpoint slim functions | ~400 ms (4-5× drop) |
| **L2** | [#147](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/issues/147) | ETag/304 keyed on `(user, latest_sync_timestamp)` — saves bandwidth on warm visits | minimal compute change; cuts the JSON-body re-send cost |
| **L3** | [#148](https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys/issues/148) | Materialize per-section caches at sync_writer commit; reads become SELECTs | ~50 ms (≈ instant) |

**L1 is required before L2 and L3 make sense** — without splitting the kitchen-sink, neither caching strategy has a sane invalidation surface. Once L1 lands, L2 is additive and L3 stays in the toolbox until the warm-visit speed of L1 stops feeling adequate.

### Post-L1 anchor — code change landed (this PR, #146)

Code-level summary of what shipped:

- `api/packs.py` — new `RequestContext` (request-scoped `cached_property` cache for config, deduplicated activities, thresholds, science, EWMA series) plus 7 packs: `get_signal_pack`, `get_today_widgets`, `get_diagnosis_pack`, `get_fitness_pack`, `get_race_pack`, `get_history_pack`, `get_science_pack`.
- `api/routes/{today,training,goal,history,science}.py` — each rewired to construct one `RequestContext` and call only the packs it needs.
- `api/deps.py` — left intact for legacy callers (`api/ai.py`, `api/routes/plan.py`, `plugins/praxys/mcp-server/server.py`); gradual deprecation, not a big-bang.
- `tests/test_packs.py` — 10 new unit tests, including a parity check that `get_signal_pack` matches `get_dashboard_data['signal']` and a cache-counting test that proves `load_data_from_db` runs exactly once per request.

Concrete work skipped per endpoint relative to legacy `get_dashboard_data`:

| Endpoint | Skips |
|---|---|
| `/api/today` | diagnosis, workout flags, sleep-perf scatter, full activity list (extracts the latest row only), 8-week compliance (computes current week only), `_compute_threshold_data` |
| `/api/training` | full activity list, race countdown, plan-staleness warnings |
| `/api/goal` | diagnosis, workout flags, sleep-perf scatter, weekly compliance, full activity list |
| `/api/history` | every metric (returns the deduplicated activities list only) |
| `/api/science` | merged activities, splits, recovery, thresholds, EWMA load, threshold trend chart — does only `load_config + load_active_science + recommend_science` |

Suite: **445 passing** (435 prior + 10 new pack tests), 1 skipped.

Production p50 / FCP measurements vs the 1358017 cn-pc-2 anchor are pending deploy + sweep — `scripts/perf_synthetic_load_check.py` and a cn-pc-2 sitespeed run will be re-anchored under a new `2026-04-26-<post-L1-sha>/` directory once this lands and traffic flows.

### Post-L2 anchor — code change landed (this PR, #147)

L2 turns the L1 split into an HTTP-cache win: warm visits skip the full body re-send when no relevant data has changed since the client's last visit.

Code-level summary of what shipped:

- `db/models.py` + `db/cache_revision.py` — new `cache_revisions(user_id, scope)` table + `bump_revisions` / `get_revisions` helpers. Per-(user, scope) monotonic counter; SQLite atomic increment; `Base.metadata.create_all` covers the new table without an ALTER migration.
- `api/etag.py` — `compute_etag(db, user_id, scopes, salt=None)` (blake2b-8 weak ETag) + `ETagGuard` + `etag_guard_for_scopes(...)` FastAPI dependency factory; per-endpoint scope map.
- `api/routes/{today,training,goal}.py` — depend on `etag_guard_for_scopes`; short-circuit to `Response(304)` when `If-None-Match` matches.
- `api/routes/history.py` — explicit guard so the ETag salt includes `?limit/offset/source` (otherwise paginated responses would replay a wrong cached page on a matching 304).
- `api/routes/science.py` — explicit guard salted with the resolved `Accept-Language` so `/api/science` doesn't 304 across languages.
- `db/sync_writer.py` — every `write_*` bumps the relevant scope when it actually inserts/updates a row.
- `api/routes/{settings,science,ai}.py` — config / plan mutation paths bump `config` / `plans` before commit so the very next read on the same connection sees the fresh ETag.
- `tests/test_etag.py` — 9 new tests (deterministic hash, scope isolation, weak-validator match, end-to-end 304, history pagination salt, settings-bumps-today).

Per-endpoint scope coverage (the union of tables each pack reads):

| Endpoint | Scopes |
|---|---|
| `/api/today` | activities, recovery, plans, fitness, config |
| `/api/training` | activities, splits, recovery, plans, fitness, config |
| `/api/goal` | activities, fitness, config |
| `/api/history` | activities, splits, config (+ `limit/offset/source` salt) |
| `/api/science` | config (+ resolved-locale salt) |

Concrete behavior unlocked relative to post-L1:

| Mutation | Endpoints that 304 next visit | Endpoints whose ETag changes |
|---|---|---|
| Sync writes activities | history, today, training, goal | history, today, training, goal |
| Sync writes recovery | goal, history, science | today, training |
| Sync writes plan rows | history, goal, science | today, training |
| Goal/settings edit | (none — config touches every pack) | today, training, goal, history, science |
| Science theory change | (none — config in every scope set) | today, training, goal, history, science |

Suite: **509 passing** (498 prior + 11 new ETag tests), 1 skipped. The +2 over the initial PR are review-driven regression guards: `test_bump_savepoint_preserves_pending_writes` (proves a concurrent first-bump cannot discard the surrounding sync's activity rows) and `test_today_etag_changes_at_midnight` (proves the time-windowed endpoints flip ETag at the server-local date boundary even with zero DB writes).

ETag computation cost is one indexed `SELECT (scope, revision) FROM cache_revisions WHERE user_id = ? AND scope IN (...)` followed by a 16-byte blake2b. Empirically <1 ms in unit tests on a fresh SQLite — well under the 50 ms p95 acceptance gate.

Baseline for the L2 measurement is the post-L1 row from PR #158 above: `/api/today` 1130 ms / `/api/training` 1379 ms / `/api/science` 206 ms p50 from App Insights. L2's win shape is different from L1's: cold visits should land ~unchanged (one extra SELECT + blake2b on the 200 path), while warm visits with a valid `If-None-Match` should collapse to the dependency cost only (well under 100 ms — the synthetic-load script's warm-burst scenario will measure this). Re-anchor will land under a new `2026-04-26-<post-L2-sha>/` directory once this PR deploys.

### Post-L3 anchor — code change landed (this PR, #148)

L3 closes the gap on cold-200 reads: when L2's `If-None-Match` doesn't match (first visit, after a sync, mid-day on a fresh client), the response is materialised from a per-section cache row instead of re-running the L1 packs.

Code-level summary of what shipped:

- `db/models.py` — new `dashboard_cache(user_id, section, source_version, payload_json, computed_at)` table, PK `(user_id, section)`. `Base.metadata.create_all` covers it without an ALTER migration. Single table instead of one-per-section (the issue spec) — same correctness, half the schema; SQLite's table-level write lock means per-section tables wouldn't even reduce contention.
- `api/dashboard_cache.py` — new module: `compute_source_version` (mirrors `compute_etag` but returns the raw revision string instead of a hash), `read_cache` / `write_cache` (savepoint-wrapped upsert so an integrity-error rollback doesn't trash the surrounding read transaction), and `cached_or_compute` (snapshot → SELECT → compare → fall through to L1 compute on mismatch → write back tagged with the snapshot). Returns **bytes** rather than a dict so the route serves the cached body verbatim via `Response(media_type="application/json")` — no FastAPI re-encoding pass on cache hits. Cache writes go through a **dedicated** `SessionLocal()` so the request session is never touched by the cache layer's commit/rollback.
- Type tightening: `Section = Literal["today", "training", "goal"]` boundary type, `SectionStats(TypedDict)` for `get_stats()` return shape, `CheckConstraint` on `dashboard_cache.section` so a buggy writer that bypasses `write_cache` cannot leave an orphan row keyed on a typo.
- `api/routes/{today,training,goal}.py` — each route is now `if guard.is_match: 304 else Response(content=cached_or_compute(...), media_type="application/json", headers={ETag, Cache-Control})`. The L1 pack-based payload builder is extracted as a private `_build_<section>_payload(user_id, db)` so the route stays compact and the cache-miss path is identical to the pre-L3 hot path.
- `tests/test_dashboard_cache.py` — 14 new tests covering the cold/warm/race-during-compute/stale-cache/midnight/scope-isolation/corrupt-row/programmer-error/typed-stats matrix.

Sections cached: `today`, `training`, `goal`. Deliberately deferred:

- `/api/history` — paginated by `limit/offset/source` query params; a single row per (user, section) would either thrash on every page change or balloon into one row per param tuple. L2 already 304s warm history visits — defer until measurements show the cold path needs help.
- `/api/science` — post-L1 p50 is ~206 ms (already inside target). The locale axis (`Accept-Language`) would require a two-key cache. Defer until measurements justify the complexity.

Race-correctness mechanism (acceptance criterion in #148): the snapshot of `source_version` is taken BEFORE the compute runs, and the cache row is written tagged with that snapshot. If a write commits between snapshot and compute-finish, the cache row gets labelled with the older revisions; the next reader sees fresh revisions, mismatches, and recomputes. We never overwrite the cache with a payload labelled fresher than the data it was built from. Two tests defend this: `test_stale_cache_falls_through_to_compute` covers post-write detection (sentinel payload, write commits, next read recomputes), and `test_race_during_compute_tags_cache_with_pre_compute_snapshot` covers the actual mid-compute race — fires `bump_revisions` from *inside* the compute callable and asserts the persisted row's `source_version` is the *pre-compute* value (the failure mode a refactor swapping the snapshot to AFTER compute would silently introduce).

Eager warmup vs lazy compute-on-miss: the issue describes either as acceptable. We ship lazy: the L1 fallback path doubles as the recompute trigger, the L2 `bump_revisions` calls in `db/sync_writer.py` and `api/routes/{settings,science,ai}.py` are exactly the right invalidation signal, and the architecture has no extra moving parts beyond the new table + helper module. If post-deploy measurements show a cold-after-sync latency spike worth eliminating, an eager warmup hook can be added on top of the same primitives without re-architecting.

Suite: **523 passing** (509 prior + 14 new cache tests), 1 skipped.

Cache-instrumentation surface: `api.dashboard_cache.get_stats()` returns `{section: {hits, misses, ratio}}` per-process; the acceptance criterion ">95 % hit ratio after 1 day" is measured from the production Application Insights stream once deployed (the in-process counters reset on worker restart and are advisory only).

Baseline for the L3 measurement is the post-L2 row above. L3's win shape is different again: warm visits (304 path, no body) stay unchanged at L2 cost; cold-200 visits — first read, post-sync read, fresh client — should collapse from `{1130, 1379, ~}` ms p50 down toward the 50 ms band the issue projects (one indexed SELECT on `dashboard_cache` + blake2b-free direct payload return). The `/api/today` p50 < 100 ms cache-hit acceptance gate measures this; re-anchor will land under `2026-04-26-<post-L3-sha>/` once this PR deploys and the synthetic-load script runs against it.

**Hold-before-merge** flag for this PR: the user has asked us to confirm the L2 PR's production test results (it merged ~3 hours before this PR was opened) before merging L3 on top. The L2 numbers will set the baseline this PR is measured against; merging L3 before L2's anchor lands would conflate the two layers' contributions in any post-merge measurement.

## Tooling state

- **Local sitespeed runner** (`scripts/sitespeed_runner.sh`) — works against any URL, supports S1/S2/S3/S4 × desktop/mobile. The cn-pc / cn-pc-2 anchor numbers above all came from this. Gold standard for "what does the operator (and CN audience) actually feel."
- **Cloud sitespeed runner** (`.github/workflows/perf-baseline.yml`) — matrix-driven (`scenario × probe × device` = up to 24 cells per dispatch), polling-bug fixed (PR-145). One cross-region quirk remaining: the 15-min polling timeout is too short for cells where the test driver in westus/northeurope is hitting an East Asia origin (~150 ms RTT × many requests = >15 min for 3 S1 iterations). Eastasia cells run cleanly. Tracked as a follow-up; the easy fix is bumping the timeout for cross-region cells or adding a state-aware deadline reset.
- **Synthetic-load validator** (`scripts/perf_synthetic_load_check.py`) — drives 30-call bursts against a deployed environment, queries App Insights for server-side p50/p95 vs a baseline window. This is what produced the PR-139 −65 % p50 measurement that synthetic browser baselines couldn't capture cleanly because of small-sample p95 noise. Reusable for every backend perf change.
- **Azure Monitor alert** — `praxys-today-latency-regression` fires when `/api/today` mean exceeds 3000 ms over a 24-h window. Catches future regressions on real traffic without us having to remember to look.

## How this checkpoint will be used

The next set of PRs (L1, L2, L3 in order) will each be measured against the cn-pc-2 column above. The acceptance gate for each layer is "Today / Training p50 reduces by at least the expected amount, no S4 / Settings / Science regression, security headers still present, suite still green." If a layer doesn't move the number, that's a signal to stop and re-diagnose rather than ship.

Anchors-of-anchors:
- Source-of-truth pre-arc: `2026-04-24-468ce25/`
- Last anchor before this checkpoint: `2026-04-26-1358017/`
- Everything below this checkpoint should compare to `1358017`'s cn-pc-2 row.
