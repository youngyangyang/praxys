# Getting Started

Full setup guide for Praxys. Choose cloud mode (hosted) or local mode (your machine).

## Cloud Mode (Recommended)

If Praxys is deployed to the cloud, you just need a browser. The CLI plugin ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) or [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/)) is optional but recommended for AI features like training plan generation, daily briefs, and race forecasts.

### 1. Register

1. Visit the app URL provided by your admin
2. Click **Register** and create an account with email + password
   - The **first user** to register becomes the admin automatically — no invitation code needed
   - All subsequent users must provide an **invitation code** to register
3. After registering, you are logged in and taken to the dashboard

**Invitation codes:** Admins generate invitation codes via the Settings page or `POST /api/auth/invite` API endpoint. Share the code with the person you want to invite. Each code is single-use. This prevents unauthorized registrations on publicly accessible deployments.

### 2. Connect Platforms

Navigate to the **Settings** page and add your data sources:

| Platform | Credentials | How to Get |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Garmin | Email + password | Your [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) account |
| Stryd | Email + password | Your [Stryd](https://www.stryd.com/) account |
| Oura | Personal access token | Generate at [cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens) |

You only need to connect the platforms you use. Unconfigured sources are skipped automatically.

**Garmin options:**
- **Region:** Select Global (connect.garmin.com) or China (connect.garmin.cn)
- **Activity types:** Choose which activity types to sync (running, trail running, etc.)

Credentials are encrypted before storage and never returned to the frontend. See [security.md](security.md) for details.

### 3. First Sync

After connecting at least one platform:

1. Go to the **Settings** page and click **Sync**
2. Choose a backfill period — **6 months** is recommended for meaningful trend analysis
3. Sync progress is shown per platform (Garmin, Stryd, Oura)
4. Once complete, data appears on the dashboard automatically

Subsequent syncs happen automatically in the background (default every 6 hours).
You can change the sync frequency in **Settings → Connected Platforms → Auto sync frequency**,
or trigger a manual sync at any time.

### 4. Configure Training

Complete these steps on the **Settings** page to get personalized analysis:

1. **Choose your training base:**
   - **Power** (recommended if you have Stryd) — uses Critical Power (CP) for zones and load
   - **Heart rate** — uses Lactate Threshold HR (LTHR) for zones, TRIMP for load
   - **Pace** — uses threshold pace for zones, rTSS for load

2. **Set your goal (optional):**
   - **Race goal:** Pick a distance (5K through 100 Mile), set a target time and race date
   - **Continuous improvement:** Pick a distance for predictions, no deadline pressure

3. **Verify thresholds:** The system auto-detects your CP, LTHR, or threshold pace from connected platforms. You can override with manual values if needed.

### Setup Checklist

- [ ] Register and log in
- [ ] Connect at least one platform (Garmin, Stryd, or Oura)
- [ ] Run first sync with 6-month backfill
- [ ] Choose your training base (power / HR / pace)
- [ ] Set a goal distance and optional target time

## Local Mode (Development / Personal Use)

Run everything on your machine. Same features, same auth flow.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for the web dashboard)
- At least one of: Garmin Connect account, Stryd account, Oura Ring

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dddtc2005/praxys.git
cd praxys

# Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd web && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and generate the required encryption key:

```bash
# Generate a Fernet encryption key
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Paste the key as the value for `PRAXYS_LOCAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`. This key encrypts platform credentials (Garmin/Stryd/Oura passwords) at rest.

`.env` settings:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PRAXYS_LOCAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | Fernet key for credential encryption. Without this, credentials won't survive restarts. |
| `PRAXYS_JWT_SECRET` | No | JWT signing key. Auto-generated if not set, but tokens won't survive restarts. |
| `PRAXYS_ADMIN_EMAIL` | No | This email can register without an invitation code. Not needed if you're the first user. |

### 3. Start the Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1: API server
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd web && npm run dev
```

### 4. Register and Set Up

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click **Register** — the first user becomes admin automatically
3. Navigate to **Settings** to connect platforms, sync data, and configure training
4. Follow the same setup steps as cloud mode above (connect, sync, configure)

### Try With Sample Data

To explore the dashboard without real credentials:

```bash
python scripts/seed_sample_data.py
```

This populates the database with 60 days of synthetic training data across all sources.

## CLI Skills (Optional)

If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) or [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/) installed, you can use all features from the terminal. See [skills.md](skills.md) for the full guide.

The CLI plugin connects to the same backend (cloud or local) and provides skills like `/daily-brief`, `/training-plan`, and `/race-forecast`.
