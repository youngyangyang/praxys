## Key Design Decisions

### Single Computation Entry Point

`api/deps.py:get_dashboard_data()` is the sole entry point for all computed data. It:
1. Loads config and data from the database (per-user)
2. Resolves thresholds (auto-detect + manual overrides)
3. Loads active science theories
4. Computes all metrics (fitness/fatigue, diagnosis, predictions, recovery)

Both the API routes and MCP plugin tools call this function. This ensures web and CLI always show identical data.

### Pure Metric Functions

All functions in `analysis/metrics.py` are pure — they take data in, return results out, with no I/O or side effects. This makes them testable and composable. I/O is handled by `data_loader.py` (reading) and `api/deps.py` (orchestration).

### SQLite Database

Training data is stored in a SQLite database (`DATA_DIR/trainsight.db`) via SQLAlchemy ORM. This replaced the earlier flat-CSV approach to support multi-user deployments:
- Per-user data isolation via `user_id` foreign keys on all data tables
- Encrypted credential storage (platform passwords never stored in plaintext)
- Atomic writes via transactions
- `data/sample/` CSVs still exist for seeding and testing

### Database Layer

**Engine:** SQLAlchemy ORM with both sync (for pandas data loading) and async (for FastAPI-Users) sessions. The database file lives at `DATA_DIR/trainsight.db` (configurable via the `DATA_DIR` environment variable, defaults to `data/`).

**Models** (defined in `db/models.py`):

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `User` | `users` | FastAPI-Users user model (email, hashed_password, is_superuser) |
| `Invitation` | `invitations` | One-time registration codes (code, created_by, used_by, is_active) |
| `UserConfig` | `user_config` | Per-user settings (training_base, thresholds, zones, goal, science, preferences) |
| `UserConnection` | `user_connections` | Platform credentials per user (encrypted_credentials, wrapped_dek, status) |
| `Activity` | `activities` | Merged activity data from all sources (distance, duration, power, HR, pace, load scores) |
| `ActivitySplit` | `activity_splits` | Per-interval split data within activities (split-level power, pace, HR) |
| `RecoveryData` | `recovery_data` | Sleep and readiness data (HRV, sleep score, resting HR, body temp) |
| `FitnessData` | `fitness_data` | Per-metric fitness tracking (VO2max, CP estimate, LTHR, max HR) |
| `TrainingPlan` | `training_plans` | Planned workouts from Stryd or AI (targets, description, meta) |

**Session management** (`db/session.py`):
- `init_db()` creates both sync and async engines, runs `create_all()`, then applies lightweight schema migrations
- `get_db()` is a FastAPI dependency yielding sync sessions
- `get_async_db()` yields async sessions for FastAPI-Users

### Auto-Migration

`init_db()` in `db/session.py` includes a lightweight migration system that runs on every startup. After `create_all()` (which only creates new tables), it inspects existing tables for missing columns and runs `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statements. This avoids needing a full Alembic setup for simple schema additions. New columns are registered in the `_migrations` list inside `init_db()`.

### Authentication

**JWT via FastAPI-Users.** All data endpoints require a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Tokens are issued by `POST /api/auth/login` (FastAPI-Users auth backend) and validated by `api/auth.py:get_current_user_id()`.

**Registration flow:**
1. First user on a fresh database becomes admin automatically (no invitation code needed)
2. A user whose email matches `TRAINSIGHT_ADMIN_EMAIL` env var registers without an invitation and becomes admin
3. All other users must provide a valid one-time invitation code (generated by an admin via `POST /api/admin/invitations`)

The custom registration endpoint (`api/routes/register.py`) enforces these rules and delegates password hashing to FastAPI-Users' `UserManager`.

### Credential Encryption

Platform credentials (Garmin/Stryd passwords, Oura tokens) are stored encrypted using envelope encryption (`db/crypto.py`):

1. A fresh **Data Encryption Key (DEK)** is generated per credential (Fernet)
2. The DEK encrypts the credential JSON
3. The DEK itself is wrapped by a **master key**:
   - **Production:** RSA key in Azure Key Vault (`KEY_VAULT_URL` + `KEY_VAULT_KEY_NAME` env vars)
   - **Development:** Local Fernet key (`TRAINSIGHT_LOCAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var)
4. Both `encrypted_credentials` and `wrapped_dek` are stored as binary columns on `UserConnection`

If `KEY_VAULT_URL` is set, the `CredentialVault` initializes an Azure `CryptographyClient`. Otherwise, it falls back to local Fernet encryption. If neither is configured, it generates an ephemeral key and logs a warning (credentials will not survive restarts).

### Admin System

Admin endpoints (`api/routes/admin.py`) are gated by `is_superuser=True` on the authenticated user. Capabilities:

- **User management:** List all users, delete a user (cascades all their data), toggle admin role
- **Invitation codes:** Generate (`TS-XXXX-XXXX` format), list with usage status, revoke
- Self-modification safeguards: admins cannot delete themselves or change their own role
- **Demo accounts:** Read-only accounts that mirror an admin's data (see below)

### Demo Accounts

Demo accounts let admins share a live, read-only view of their dashboard with others.

**Data model:** Two columns on `User`: `is_demo: bool` and `demo_of: FK → users.id`. When `is_demo` is true, all data queries resolve to `demo_of` (the admin's user_id) instead of the demo user's own id.

**Auth dependencies (`api/auth.py`):**
- `get_current_user_id` — resolves the authenticated user (unchanged)
- `get_data_user_id` — returns `demo_of` for demo users, own `user_id` for normal users. Used on all READ endpoints.
- `require_write_access` — raises 403 for demo users. Used on all WRITE endpoints.

**How it works:**
1. Admin creates a demo account via `POST /api/admin/demo-accounts` (email + password)
2. The demo user is created with `is_demo=True, demo_of=<admin's user_id>`
3. Demo user logs in normally (JWT auth) but all data reads are scoped to the admin's data
4. All write operations (settings, sync, plans, connections) return 403
5. Frontend shows a persistent amber banner: "Live demo with real training data — read-only mode"
6. Settings page is visually dimmed with pointer-events disabled

**Key design decisions:**
- No data duplication — demo users see live data that updates when the admin syncs
- Each admin's demo accounts only see that admin's data (supports multiple admins)
- Server-side enforcement — even direct API calls get 403, not just UI hiding

### Pluggable Science Framework

Training theories (load models, zone frameworks, prediction methods, recovery protocols) are YAML files in `data/science/`. The user selects one theory per pillar in their config. This means:
- Metrics adapt to the selected theory (zone boundaries, time constants, etc.)
- New theories can be added by creating a YAML file — no code changes
- Citations link back to the original research papers

### Multi-Source Data Merging

Activities can come from Garmin, Stryd, or Coros. `data_loader.py` merges them:
- Primary source set via `config.preferences.activities`
- Secondary sources enrich with additional columns (e.g., Stryd adds power to Garmin activities)
- Matching uses date + timestamp proximity (handles timezone differences)

### MCP Plugin

The Trainsight MCP plugin (`plugins/trainsight/mcp-server/server.py`) provides 12 tools for Claude Code and Copilot CLI. It operates in two modes:

**Remote mode** (`TRAINSIGHT_URL` env var set):
- All tool calls proxy to the deployed API via HTTP
- JWT token read from `~/.trainsight/token`
- Used by end users connecting to the cloud deployment

**Local mode** (`TRAINSIGHT_URL` not set):
- Direct Python imports from the project codebase
- Uses the first active user in the local database (or `TRAINSIGHT_USER_ID` override)
- `get_dashboard_data()` called directly, no HTTP overhead
- Used during development

**Tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_daily_brief` | Today's training signal, recovery, upcoming workouts |
| `get_training_review` | Zone distribution, fitness/fatigue, diagnosis, suggestions |
| `get_race_forecast` | Race prediction, CP trend, goal feasibility |
| `get_training_context` | Full context for AI plan generation |
| `get_settings` | Current user settings and display config |
| `update_settings` | Update training base, thresholds, zones, goal |
| `get_connections` | Connected platforms and their status |
| `connect_platform` | Store encrypted credentials for a platform |
| `disconnect_platform` | Remove platform credentials |
| `push_training_plan` | Upload AI-generated plan as CSV |
| `trigger_sync` | Trigger data sync from connected platforms |
| `get_sync_status` | Check sync status for all platforms |

## Module Responsibilities

### db/

Database layer:
- **`models.py`**: 9 SQLAlchemy ORM models (see Database Layer section above)
- **`session.py`**: Engine initialization, `init_db()` with auto-migration, `get_db()`/`get_async_db()` FastAPI dependencies
- **`crypto.py`**: `CredentialVault` class — envelope encryption with Azure Key Vault or local Fernet fallback
- **`sync_writer.py`**: Upsert helpers for writing sync data (activities, splits, recovery, fitness, plans)
- **`csv_import.py`**: One-time migration from flat CSVs to database
- **`sync_scheduler.py`**: Optional background sync scheduler (per-user, periodic)

### sync/

Each sync script (`garmin_sync.py`, `stryd_sync.py`, `oura_sync.py`) is self-contained:
- Authenticates with the platform API
- Fetches new data since last sync (or from `--from-date`)
- Normalizes to the model schema
- Writes to the database via `db/sync_writer.py`

`sync_all.py` orchestrates all three with error isolation per source.

### analysis/

- **`config.py`**: `UserConfig` dataclass, `load_config()`/`save_config()` (file), `load_config_from_db()`/`save_config_to_db()` (DB), platform capabilities, zone defaults
- **`data_loader.py`**: `load_data()` returns a dict of DataFrames: `activities`, `splits`, `recovery`, `fitness`, `plan`
- **`metrics.py`**: ~40 pure functions covering RSS, TRIMP, EWMA, TSB, predictions, diagnosis, recovery analysis
- **`zones.py`**: Computes zone ranges from threshold + boundary fractions
- **`science.py`**: Loads YAML theories, merges with label sets, provides `load_active_science()`
- **`training_base.py`**: Display config per training base (labels, units, abbreviations)
- **`providers/`**: Platform-specific adapters for threshold detection and plan loading

### api/

- **`main.py`**: FastAPI app, lifespan (init_db, optional sync scheduler), CORS (local dev only), route registration
- **`auth.py`**: JWT validation middleware — `get_current_user_id()` extracts user ID from Bearer token
- **`users.py`**: FastAPI-Users integration — auth backend, user manager, transport configuration
- **`deps.py`**: The big orchestrator. `get_dashboard_data()` loads everything, computes everything, returns a dict consumed by all routes.
- **`ai.py`**: `build_training_context()` serializes dashboard data into LLM-optimized JSON. `validate_plan()` checks generated plans.
- **`routes/`**: Each route file is a thin wrapper extracting relevant keys from `get_dashboard_data()`. Includes `register.py` (custom registration with invitation codes) and `admin.py` (user/invitation management).

### web/

React SPA (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui):
- **`pages/`**: 4 pages matching dashboard tabs (Today, Training, Goal, Settings) + Science
- **`components/`**: UI components, one per card/section
- **`hooks/`**: `useApi<T>` for data fetching with loading/error states
- **`types/api.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces matching API response shapes
- **`lib/chart-theme.ts`**: Single source of truth for chart colors

### plugins/trainsight/

MCP plugin for Claude Code and Copilot CLI:
- **`mcp-server/server.py`**: 12 tools with dual-mode execution (see MCP Plugin section)
- **`mcp-server/auth.py`**: Token management helpers for remote mode

### .claude/skills/

8 skill directories, each with a `SKILL.md` (instructions for AI tools). Skills that need data have corresponding Python CLI tools in the top-level `scripts/` directory that output JSON to stdout.

## Data Flow Examples

    → _resolve_thresholds() → auto-detect CP from fitness_data
    → load_active_science() → get recovery theory params
    → analyze_recovery() → HRV status (Kiviniemi/Plews)
    → daily_training_signal() → Go/Modify/Rest
  → extract signal + recovery + upcoming + last activity
  → JSON response
```

### "Diagnose my training"

```
GET /api/training (with Bearer token)
  → get_current_user_id() → JWT validation → user_id
  → get_dashboard_data(user_id, db)
    → load_data() → activities + splits from DB
    → diagnose_training(merged, splits, cp_trend, ...)
      → volume analysis (weekly km, trend)
      → consistency check (gaps, session count)
      → interval intensity (split-level, supra-CP sessions)
      → zone distribution (actual vs target from theory)
      → _add_diagnosis_items() → findings + suggestions
  → JSON response
